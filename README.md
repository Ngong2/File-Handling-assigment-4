Overview
The File Processor is a Python program that reads a text file, converts its content to uppercase, and writes the modified content to a new file. It includes comprehensive error handling for various file operations scenarios.

Features
File Reading: Reads content from any text file

Content Modification: Converts text to uppercase

Automatic File Creation: Offers to create a file if it doesn't exist

Error Handling: Handles file not found, permission errors, and other I/O issues

Preview Display: Shows previews of both original and modified content

Smart Naming: Creates output files with "modified_" prefix while preserving extensions

How to Use
Run the program:

bash
python file_processor.py
Enter the filename when prompted:

text
Please enter the name of the file to read: example.txt
If the file doesn't exist, the program will offer to create it:

text
Error: The file 'example.txt' does not exist.
Would you like to create this file? (y/n): y
The program will process the file and create a modified version:

text
File successfully read!
Content successfully written to 'modified_example.txt'.
The modified file has been created.
Error Handling
The program handles several error scenarios:

FileNotFoundError: When the specified file doesn't exist

PermissionError: When the program doesn't have read/write permissions

IOError: General input/output errors

Other exceptions: Catches any unexpected errors

Output Files
The program creates output files with the naming pattern:

Input: filename.txt

Output: modified_filename.txt

The extension is preserved in the output filename.

Example
Input file (example.txt):

text
Hello, this is a sample text.
Python file handling is important.
Output file (modified_example.txt):

text
HELLO, THIS IS A SAMPLE TEXT.
PYTHON FILE HANDLING IS IMPORTANT.
Requirements
Python 3.x

No external dependencies required

Code Structure
The program consists of a single function process_file() that:

Prompts for a filename

Checks if the file exists

Offers to create the file if it doesn't exist

Reads the file content

Converts content to uppercase

Writes to a new file

Displays previews of both files

Limitations
Processes text files only

Modifies content to uppercase only (easily customizable)

No batch processing of multiple files

Customization
To modify the transformation behavior, change the content modification step (step 4 in the code). For example, to convert to lowercase instead:

python
# Change this line:
modified_content = content.upper()

# To:
modified_content = content.lower()
